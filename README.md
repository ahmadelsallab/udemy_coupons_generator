# Udemy Bulk Coupons Generator

## Overview

This repository provides an automated solution for generating, editing, and managing Udemy bulk coupons, along with creating LinkedIn posts to promote courses. Instead of going through the manual process of downloading, generating, and uploading coupon files, this project automates the process using a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** or a **Flask web app**. 

### Manual Process:
Instructors typically follow these steps to generate bulk coupons on Udemy:
1. **Download Eligible Courses**: Instructors must download the eligible courses information by navigating to [Udemy's Multiple Coupons Creation API](https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/discounts/multiple-coupons-creation/export-instructor-courses/) or through their instructor dashboard. This `.csv` file contains the course information necessary to generate coupons.
2. **Generate Coupons**: Instructors manually create a `.csv` file containing coupon codes, types, and other details, which can be uploaded via Udemyâ€™s [Bulk Coupons Creation](https://www.udemy.com/instructor/multiple-coupons-creation/) page.
3. **Upload Coupons**: The `.csv` file is uploaded to Udemy to activate the coupons. This step requires navigating to the [Bulk Coupons Creation](https://www.udemy.com/instructor/multiple-coupons-creation/) page and submitting the generated `.csv`.
4. **Download Active Coupons**: Once the coupons are generated, instructors can download the active coupons using the [Export Instructor Coupons API](https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/discounts/multiple-coupons-creation/export-instructor-coupons/) to get a `.csv` of the active coupons.

### Automated Process:
This project streamlines the process by automating coupon generation, modification, and LinkedIn post creation. Instead of manually handling multiple CSV files, the system can:
1. **CLI Version**:
   - Automatically process eligible courses, generate coupon codes, and save the details to a `.csv` file.
   - Allow users to modify the coupons before uploading them to Udemy.
   - Generate LinkedIn posts with coupon links for easy promotion.
   
2. **Flask App Version**:
   - A user-friendly web interface allows for the upload of eligible course data, automatic generation of coupon codes, and easy modification of coupon details.
   - Generate LinkedIn posts from active coupons, streamlining the entire promotional workflow.

## Usage

### 1. Command-Line Interface (CLI)

#### Prerequisites:
- Install the required dependencies (e.g., `csv`, `argparse`, `uuid`).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Steps to Generate Bulk Coupons via CLI:
1. Get Eligible Courses from Udemy:

    - Log in to your Udemy Instructor account.
    - Navigate to Udemy's [Multiple Coupons Creation API](https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/discounts/multiple-coupons-creation/export-instructor-courses/) to download the `eligible_courses.csv`. This file contains details about the eligible courses, including course ID, name, pricing, and other metadata.

2. Generate the Coupons CSV:

    - Run the `coupons.py` script to generate the initial coupons CSV. You can optionally provide a `previous_coupons.csv` file if you have previous coupon data to reuse the same types.
    ``` bash
    python coupons.py --eligible_courses eligible_courses.csv --date 2024-10-11 --previous_coupons previous_coupons.csv
    ```

    - This will generate a `coupons_<date>.csv` file based on the eligible courses and any previous coupon data.

3. Modify the Coupons:

    - You can open the generated coupons.csv to manually modify any details, such as coupon types, custom pricing, etc.

4. Upload the Coupons to Udemy:

    - Go to [Udemy's Bulk Coupons Creation page](https://www.udemy.com/instructor/multiple-coupons-creation/) and upload the `coupons.csv` file.
    - Udemy will process the file and generate the coupons.

5. Download Active Coupons from Udemy:

    - After the bulk coupons have been created, download the active coupons using the [Export Instructor Coupons API](https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/discounts/multiple-coupons-creation/export-instructor-coupons/). Save this file as `active_coupons.csv`.

6. Generate LinkedIn Post:

    - Use the post.py script to generate a LinkedIn post that contains the course names and active coupon links.
        ``` bash 
        python post.py --active_coupons active_coupons.csv --post_template post_template.txt --eligible_courses eligible_courses.csv --date 2024-10-11 
        ```

    - The LinkedIn post will be saved in a .txt file (`post_<date>.txt`), ready for you to copy and paste into your LinkedIn account.
